MINERful
=========================

MINERful is a fast process mining tool for discovering declarative process specifications out of event logs. Event logs can be either real or synthetic, stored as [XES](http://www.xes-standard.org/), [MXML](http://www.processmining.org/logs/mxml), or text files (a collection of strings, in which every character is considered as an event, every line as a trace). Among the other things, MINERful can also create synthetic logs and export them as [XES](http://www.xes-standard.org/) or [MXML](http://www.processmining.org/logs/mxml) files, simplify existing Declare specifications, and import/export specifications written in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) or in the ConDec native language. Simply play around with it!
